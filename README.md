# FortuneCookieChat
Using Socket programming to allow a client and a server to exchange random "fortune cookies"

## Description
In this project, I am using the Socket class provided my java to have two independent hosts communicating with each other.
The way they communicate is one of the hosts asks for a fortune cookie and the other one chooses a random cookie out of a list and sends it to that host.
Moreover, the two hosts can exchange messages in a basic chat as well.
